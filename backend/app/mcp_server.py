"""Wairz MCP Server — exposes firmware analysis tools via the Model Context Protocol.

Usage:
    wairz-mcp --project-id <uuid> [--firmware-id <uuid>]

Connects to the Wairz database, loads the specified project and firmware,
then serves all registered analysis tools over stdio for MCP-compatible
clients (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, OpenCode, etc.).

When a project has multiple firmware versions, --firmware-id selects a
specific one. Without it, the earliest-uploaded unpacked firmware is used.

Supports dynamic project switching via the switch_project tool — no need
to restart the MCP server process when changing projects.
