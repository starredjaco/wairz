# MCP Tools Reference

Wairz exposes 90+ tools to Claude via the Model Context Protocol. This page lists all available tools organized by category.

!!! note "Tool visibility is firmware-kind aware"
    Some tools only apply to certain firmware kinds (Linux vs RTOS). When you `switch_project`, the MCP server emits `notifications/tools/list_changed` and the client refreshes its tool list automatically:

    - **Linux-only tools** (emulation, init-script analysis, setuid scanning, component map, etc.) are hidden when the active project's firmware is RTOS or unknown.
    - **RTOS-only tools** (vector-table parsing, task enumeration, base-address recovery, memory map) are hidden when the active project is Linux.

    Tools without an explicit kind tag apply to all firmware. The kind discriminator is described in [RTOS Support](features/rtos.md).
